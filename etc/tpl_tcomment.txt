*tcomment.txt*  An easily extensible & universal comment plugin
                Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

tcomment provides easy to use, file-type sensible comments for Vim. It 
can handle embedded syntax.

TComment works like a toggle, i.e., it will comment out text that 
contains uncommented lines, and it will remove comment markup for 
already commented text (i.e. text that contains no uncommented lines).

If the file-type is properly defined, TComment will figure out which 
comment string to use. Otherwise you use |tcomment#type#Define()| to 
override the default choice.

TComment can properly handle an embedded syntax, e.g., ruby/python/perl 
regions in vim scripts, HTML or JavaScript in php code etc.

tcomment favours the use of line-wise comment styles. This implies that usually 
whole line will be commented out. tcomment also knows block-style and inline 
comments that can be used via special maps (see below) or the |:TCommentAs| 
command.

Key bindings~

Most of the time the default toggle keys will do what you want (or to be 
more precise: what I think you want it to do ;-).

                                                    *tcomment-operator*
As operator (the prefix can be customized via |g:tcomment_opleader1|):

    gc{motion}   :: Toggle comments (for small comments within one line 
                    the &filetype_inline style will be used, if 
                    defined)
    gc<Count>c{motion} :: Toggle comment with count argument 
                    (see |tcomment#Comment()|)
    gcc          :: Toggle comment for the current line

Force line-wise operation:
    gC{motion}   :: Toggle comments by line
    gC<Count>c{motion} :: Toggle comment by line with count argument 
                    (see |tcomment#Comment()|)

Explicit commenting/uncommenting:

    g<{motion}   :: Uncomment region
    g<c          :: Uncomment the current line
    g<b          :: Uncomment the current region as block

    g>{motion}   :: Comment region
    g>c          :: Comment the current line
    g>b          :: Comment the current region as block

In visual mode:

    gc           :: Toggle comments
    g>           :: Comment selected text

CAVEAT: If you visually select text within a line, the visual mode map will 
comment out the selected text. If you selected text across several lines, the 
visual mode map will assume though that you wanted to comment out lines -- 
since this is how many vim maps work. In order to make tcomment use e.g. inline 
comments anyway, use the <c-_>i map -- see below.

By default the cursor stays put. If you want the cursor to the end of 
the commented text, set |g:tcomment#operator#mode_extra| to '>' (but this may not 
work properly with exclusive motions).

Primary key maps for normal and insert mode (see also |g:tcomment_mapleader1|):

    <c-_><c-_>   :: :TComment
    <c-_><space> :: :TComment <QUERY COMMENT-BEGIN ?COMMENT-END>
    <c-_>b       :: :TCommentBlock
                    In insert mode, the cursor will be positioned inside 
                    the comment. In normal mode, the cursor will stay 
                    put.
    <c-_>a       :: :TCommentAs <QUERY COMMENT TYPE>
    <c-_>n       :: :TCommentAs &filetype <QUERY COUNT>
    <c-_>s       :: :TCommentAs &filetype_<QUERY COMMENT SUBTYPE>
    <c-_>i       :: :TCommentInline (in normal and insert mode, this map will 
                    create an empty inline comment, which isn't suitable for 
                    all filetypes though)
                    In insert mode, the cursor will be positioned inside 
                    the comment. In normal mode, the cursor will stay 
                    put.
    <c-_>r       :: :TCommentRight
    <c-_>p       :: Comment the current inner paragraph
    <c-_><Count> :: Set the count argument (a number from 1 to 9) for use with 
                    the subsequent tcomment map/command (see 
                    |tcomment#Comment()|)
                    E.g. in JavaScript, in order to get an empty /** */ 
                    comment for documentation purposes, in insert mode type 
                    <c-_>2<c-_>i
                    In order to get an empty block comment like >
                      /**
                       *
                       */
<                   type <c-_>2<c-_>b

Most of the above maps are also available in visual mode.

A secondary set of key maps is defined for normal and insert mode (see also 
|g:tcomment_mapleader2|):

    <Leader>__       :: :TComment
    <Leader>_p       :: Comment the current inner paragraph
    <Leader>_<space> :: :TComment <QUERY COMMENT-BEGIN ?COMMENT-END>
    <Leader>_i       :: :TCommentInline
    <Leader>_r       :: :TCommentRight
    <Leader>_b       :: :TCommentBlock
    <Leader>_a       :: :TCommentAs <QUERY COMMENT TYPE>
    <Leader>_n       :: :TCommentAs &filetype <QUERY COUNT>
    <Leader>_s       :: :TCommentAs &filetype_<QUERY COMMENT SUBTYPE>

... and for select mode:

    <Leader>__       :: :TComment
    <Leader>_i       :: :TCommentInline
